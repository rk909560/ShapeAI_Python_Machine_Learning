Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI 3 </b>.

Editing ShapeALPY

The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to 5 learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:

<li>Python

<li>Machine Learning

<li>Tensorflow

<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that

anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.

I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit: 15 <a href="https://www.shapeal.tech"> www.shapeal.tech</a>
